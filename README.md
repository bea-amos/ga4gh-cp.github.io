## GA4GH Clinical & Phenotypic Data Capture & Exchange

The "Clinical & Phenotypic Data Capture & Exchange" ([GA4GH::CP](http://ga4gh-cp.github.io)) Work Stream is one of the elements of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org)), aimed at developing standard formats for the exchange of genomic data for research and biomedical applications.  All members of this team must follow the [GA4GH Standards of Professional Conduct]( https://www.ga4gh.org/docs/GA4GH-Standards-for-Professional-Conduct_22-Jan-2018.pdf).

The current focus of Clin/Pheno Work Stream lies in establishing best practice guidelines for use of phenotype ontologies and terminologies in clinical & research settings, and in supporting the creation of information models for the exchange of clinical and genomic information.
